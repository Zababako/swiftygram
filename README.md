[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zababako/swiftygram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zababako/swiftygram) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/zapko/swiftygram/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/zapko/swiftygram)

A lightweight Telegram Bot API client in Swift.


# What this project is about

This is a Swift wrapper for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). 
It\`s intended for people who want to write a bot,Â but don\`t want a hassle of writing
proper requests formating, responses parsing and mapping into meaningful Swift structures. 
This project is built completely on language features and has no dependencies. 

## Benefits

- Threadsafe
- Zero dependencies
- Can restrain requests frequency to respect API usage limits


# What this project is not about

SwiftygramBot doesn\`t make any assumptions on how your bot business logic should work. 
There is no routing, no errors or commands handling.
